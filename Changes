        Initial release.

0.02    2008-06-30

        Adaptive algorithm selection should mean we're always
        faster than Set::IntSpan::Fast.

        Implemented union in terms of _merge. Much faster. Also
        speeds up, e.g. intersection and anything else that
        calls union directly or indirectly.

0.03    2008-07-01

        Magic @ISA bashing allows us to be loaded automatically by
        Set::IntSpan::Fast.

0.04    2008-07-01

        New version of S::I::F makes @ISA bashing redundant.

0.05    2009-03-08

        Don't mask _list_to_ranges with out own incompatible version.
